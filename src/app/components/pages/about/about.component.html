  <h1>About us</h1>
  <p>Our Mission is create a loving and caring community that will change your gaming experience<br>
    into not just playing the game you love but making friends while doing so. We will reach this<br>
    goal by hosting weekly events which will bring the community together and using interactive<br>
    casters while we stream to engage the game with the community. The game we normally play<br>
    as a community is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</p>
  <p>We are EU based but that's not to say people from elsewhere canâ€™t play as long as your<br>
    internet is good! Our events consist of CSGO 5v5s and sometimes bigger events with 3+ teams<br>
    of 5, this would normally run on a Saturday. We also do a games night on Sunday, which is<br>
    usually is on Tabletop Simulator or Monopoly, but is not exclusive to those games.</p>
